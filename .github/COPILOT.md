# GitHub Copilot Guidelines

This project now uses **Astro** with React components and TypeScript. Follow these rules when using GitHub Copilot:

- Prefer Astro components for markup and React only when interactive islands are required.
- Keep code concise and comment using US English.
- Use Biome for linting and formatting.
- Ensure all pages remain accessible and responsive.
